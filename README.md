# pointBelongSegment
Geometrically, this function tells us whether a point belongs a segment using the easiest way through distances.
- The function is written in JavaScript.
- It works fine using projected cartesian coordinates.

All what you need is to pass these arguments: Lx1, Ly1, Lx2, Ly2, Px, Py
- Lx1: _first point which defines the line. Coordinate X_
- Ly1: _first point which defines the line. Coordinate Y_
- Lx2: _second point which defines the line. Coordinate X_
- Ly2: _second point which defines the line. Coordinate Y_
- Px: _the point to analyze. Coordinate X_
- Py: _the point to analyze. Coordinate Y_

If the point belongs the segment, then you'll get **true**.
